### Summary ###
* App Name: MetaPURPOSE: A Cloud-Based Metabolite and Chemical Prioritization System for the Biology/Disease-driven Human Proteome Project.
* Version: 1.0.0


### Dependencies ###
* R version 3 or above
* R packages: shiny, shinyjs, shinyBS, shinysky, V8, ggplot2, plotly.


### Summary of Methods ###
* Metabolites/chemicals are prioritized by the Protein Universal Reference Publication-Originated Search Engine (PURPOSE), defined as
(1 + log10(nTC) + log10((Sum(Cit/yr)+1)/10)) * (1 + log10(nU/nT) + log10(nU/nC)),
where nTC is the number of PubMed publication related to both the chemical and topic (TC), Cit/yr is the sum of the annualized number of citation of TC, nU is the number of PubMed publication, nT is the number of publication regarding the topic of interest, and nC is the number of publication regarding the chemical of interest.

* The most updated PubTator data is obtained from its File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site. An automated downloader is implemented in "updater_chemical2pubtator_PURPOSE_project.java"

* The number of PubMed publications and citations are retrieved by eSummary tools, and the platform is implemented in Java and R.
